Explaination:

The area of a circle is given by - pi * (r^2)
Now for a circle of radius = 1, the area becomes - pi

The program "area_calculation.chpl" calculates the area of the semi-circle, by summing up the area of large number(numRect) of thin rectangles and then multiplying the result(totalSum) with 2.
